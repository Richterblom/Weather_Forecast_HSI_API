# Weather_Forecast_HSI_API
The first project using the following:
Python
FastAPI

Created an application that uses the endpoint /weather to check the latitude and longitude from an API that I connected using the Python requests library to calculate the heat stress index of cow's milk as well as adding some exception handling.
